# Ex.No: 2 	Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230135
 
### Aim:
To compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) within a specific use case, such as summarizing text or answering technical questions. Generate a Prompt based output using different Prompting tools of 2024.
### AI Tools required:

### Explanation:
Define the Use Case:
Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical question, or generating a creative story / Code).
Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quality, accuracy, and depth.
Create a Set of Prompts:
Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case.
Each prompt should be clear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input.
Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility of each platform in handling different aspects of the use case.
Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform:
Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses.
Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such as input format, time to respond, and prompt delivery.
Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issues encountered.
Evaluate Response Quality:
Assess each platform‚Äôs responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,Relevance 
Compare Performance:
Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms.
Identify any platform-specific advantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces.
Deliverables:
A comparison table outlining the performance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance of responses.
A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for different use cases based on performance and user 

### Output:
# 1. ChatGPT (GPT-4/5) + Structured Output Prompt
Prompt:
‚ÄúSummarize this article on blockchain in under 300 words for undergraduate students. Use three sections: (1) What blockchain is, (2) How it works, (3) Why it matters.‚Äù

Output (sample):
```
1. What blockchain is:
Blockchain is a digital ledger system where information is stored across many computers instead of one central server. It records transactions in blocks that are linked together, making the data permanent and tamper-proof.

2. How it works:
Each block contains a list of transactions and a unique code (hash). Once added, blocks are connected to the chain in chronological order. A consensus system ensures everyone agrees on the data, preventing fraud.

3. Why it matters:
Blockchain provides security, transparency, and trust without needing banks or central authorities. It supports cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also supply chain tracking, voting systems, and digital identity management.

# 2. Claude + Role-based Prompt
```
Prompt:
‚ÄúYou are a university lecturer. Explain this blockchain article to first-year undergraduates in a friendly and clear way.‚Äù

Output (sample):
‚ÄúImagine a notebook that everyone in class can see, but no one can erase. That‚Äôs blockchain. Instead of one person holding it, copies are everywhere. When a new note is added, the whole class agrees it‚Äôs valid before it‚Äôs written permanently. This prevents cheating. Blockchain isn‚Äôt just about Bitcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs about trust. It can track food safety, secure elections, and protect medical records. Think of it as the internet‚Äôs way of keeping receipts safe forever.‚Äù

# 3. Gemini + Zero-shot Prompt
```
Prompt:
‚ÄúSummarize this blockchain article in simple words.‚Äù

Output (sample):
‚ÄúBlockchain is a record-keeping system that works without banks. Data is stored in linked ‚Äòblocks.‚Äô Each block is secure and can‚Äôt be changed. People use it for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and also for things like shipping, voting, and contracts. Its main strength is trust and transparency.‚Äù

# 4. Cohere + Step-by-step Prompt
```
Prompt (2-step):
Step 1: ‚ÄúList the main points of this blockchain article.‚Äù
Step 2: ‚ÄúNow explain those points simply, as if to high schoolers.‚Äù

Output (sample):
‚ÄúBlockchain is:

A digital ledger shared by many computers.

Each block stores transactions permanently.

Security is ensured by agreement among users.

It powers Bitcoin and many other uses.

In simple words: Blockchain is like a shared Google Doc where every change is locked forever. It helps people trust information without needing a teacher or bank to watch over it.‚Äù
